~Ty's Simplified Summoning~

Ty's Simplified Summoning is a relatively small quality of life mod made to improve the process of summoning minions/sentries and generally make it less tedious to do. It does this through several ways:

- Summon weapons all have their mana costs removed as they barely affect balance and mostly just slows down the summoning process.
- Summon weapons all have their abysmally slow use reduced to speed up the process of getting your minions out.
- Summon weapons all have auto reuse enabled so you don't need to get a hand cramp to summon them quickly.
- Summon weapons all now display their use speeds because why don't they!? They even have modifiers that effect it!

All the features above affect both modded and vanilla items and can be enabled or disabled via the mod config and there is also a configurable blacklist which can be used to blacklist certain items from being affected by this mod.
